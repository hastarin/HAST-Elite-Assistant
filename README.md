HAST Elite Assistant
====================

![Image of application in use](http://i.imgur.com/lt6uSUh.png)

My [gamer personality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_Test) is firmly in the Explorer category so naturally [Elite Dangerous](https://www.elitedangerous.com/) offers some appeal, but I've felt hampered by the in game systems for navigation and exploration.  There are other 3rd party applications out there, but none did quite what I wanted, and so *HAST Elite Assistant* was born.

My day job involves writing applications in WPF and C# so it was a natural choice for this application.  

Latest Release
--------------
The latest release will always be made available [here on Github](https://github.com/hastarin/HAST-Elite-Assistant/releases).

Requirements
------------
* SQL Server Express (LocalDb as a minimum)
* You must run it on the same machine as [Elite Dangerous](https://www.elitedangerous.com/).
* Transparency features require Aero is enabled.
* VerboseLogging=1 enabled in the [Elite Dangerous](https://www.elitedangerous.com/) AppConfig.xaml

You can get SQL Server Express 2012 from here:
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=29062

*ENU\x64\SqlLocalDB.MSI* is the version you'll want unless you're on a 32 bit version of Windows in which case you can save a few MB and get *ENU\x86\SqlLocaLDB.MSI*

Finally you'll need to make sure your AppConfig.xaml found in your *Frontier_Developments\Products\FORC-FDEV-D-1003* folder has VerboseLogging=1 set for the Network section similar to the following:
```
	<Network
	  Port="0"
      upnpenabled="1"
	  LogFile="netLog"
	  DatestampLog="1"
	  VerboseLogging="1"
	  >

	</Network>
```

Current Features
----------------
* Auto imports [systems.json](https://github.com/SteveHodge/ed-systems/blob/master/systems.json) from https://github.com/SteveHodge/ed-systems/ on initial startup
* Nearly instantaneous *(though currently non optimal)* route planning
* Topmost and Transparency support to display over the game
* Highlights the next system in the route when you enter a new system
* Copies the next system to the clipboard (can be disabled in settings)
* Speaks a warning when you enter a system that's not in the system data.  Add it to [EDStarCoordinator](http://edstarcoordinator.com/) and future versions will import it.
* A settings flyout so users can edit various settings
* Speech options (enabled by default)
* Hotkey support (handy for use with Voice Attack)

The hotkeys I support are based on those of [Elite Copilot](https://github.com/w0nk0/Elite-Copilot):
* F20 - Will speak the next system
* F22 - Will avoid the next system *(NOTE: You'll need to edit your preferences to remove it)*
* F23 - Will swap source/destination

Future plans
------------
The current [list of enhancements](https://github.com/hastarin/HAST.Elite.Dangerous.DataAssistant/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement) is a long one.

If you do choose to try the app, please feel free to [log any issues](https://github.com/hastarin/HAST.Elite.Dangerous.DataAssistant/issues) you encounter.  If you're lucky I might fix them eventually.

For anyone needing it, there is code in there to read data from [EDDN](https://github.com/jamesremuscat/EDDN/wiki) but it's not currently in use.
