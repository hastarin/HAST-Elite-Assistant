HAST Elite Assistant
====================

![Image of application in use](http://i.imgur.com/lt6uSUh.png)

My [gamer personality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_Test) is firmly in the Explorer category so naturally Elite Dangerous offers some appeal, but I've felt hampered by the in game systems for navigation and exploration.  There are other 3rd party applications out there, but none did quite what I wanted, and so *HAST Elite Assistant* was born.

My day job involves writing applications in WPF and C# so it was a natural choice for this application.  

Latest Release
--------------
The latest release will always be made available [here on Github](https://github.com/hastarin/HAST-Elite-Assistant/releases).

Current Features
----------------
* Auto imports [systems.json](https://github.com/SteveHodge/ed-systems/blob/master/systems.json) from https://github.com/SteveHodge/ed-systems/ on initial startup
* Nearly instantaneous *(though currently non optimal)* route planning
* Topmost and Transparency support to display over the game
* Highlights the next system in the route when you enter a new system
* Copies the next system to the clipboard
* Speaks a warning when you enter a system that's not in the system data.  Add it to [EDStarCoordinator](http://edstarcoordinator.com/) and future versions will import it.

Future plans
------------
The current [list of enhancements](https://github.com/hastarin/HAST.Elite.Dangerous.DataAssistant/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement) is a long one.

If you do choose to try the app, please feel free to [log any issues](https://github.com/hastarin/HAST.Elite.Dangerous.DataAssistant/issues) you encounter.  If you're lucky I might fix them eventually.

For anyone needing it, there is code in there to read data from [EDDN](https://github.com/jamesremuscat/EDDN/wiki) but it's not currently in use.
