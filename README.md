HAST Elite Assistant
==================================

For the short term this app will focus on providing a navigation aid for Commanders and data entry aid for explorers.

The current version should be considered Alpha software and I won't be offering any support.  Use it at your own risk!

The current version can be used to rapidly find a route between systems.  The route may not be an optimal one, something I hope to improve upon in the future, but for now it's basically instantaneous.  The application window can be pinned on top and it's transparency can be adjusted.  If you play [Elite Dangerous](https://www.elitedangerous.com/) in a full screen window this can be quite handy.

It also speaks a warning via Windows TTS when you enter a system that isn't known in the systems.json file from https://github.com/SteveHodge/ed-systems that it obtains on first startup.  If you hear that you should probably go to [EDStarCoordinator](http://edstarcoordinator.com/) and enter the system.

There is code in there to read data from [EDDN](https://github.com/jamesremuscat/EDDN/wiki) but it's not currently in use.

The current [list of enhancements](https://github.com/hastarin/HAST.Elite.Dangerous.DataAssistant/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement) is a long one.

If you do choose to try the app, please feel free to [log any issues](https://github.com/hastarin/HAST.Elite.Dangerous.DataAssistant/issues) you encounter.  If you're lucky I might fix them eventually.
