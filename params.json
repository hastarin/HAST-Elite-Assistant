{"name":"Hast Elite Assistant","tagline":"This will hopefully come to be a windows application to assist commanders in Elite Dangerous with managing navigation and trade data.","body":"HAST Elite Assistant\r\n====================\r\n\r\n![Image of application in use](http://i.imgur.com/lt6uSUh.png)\r\n\r\nMy [gamer personality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_Test) is firmly in the Explorer category so naturally [Elite Dangerous](https://www.elitedangerous.com/) offers some appeal, but I've felt hampered by the in game systems for navigation and exploration.  There are other 3rd party applications out there, but none did quite what I wanted, and so *HAST Elite Assistant* was born.\r\n\r\nMy day job involves writing applications in WPF and C# so it was a natural choice for this application.  \r\n\r\nLatest Release\r\n--------------\r\nThe latest release will always be made available [here on Github](https://github.com/hastarin/HAST-Elite-Assistant/releases).\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\nThe app requires you run it on the same machine as [Elite Dangerous](https://www.elitedangerous.com/).\r\n\r\nYou'll also need to make sure your App.xaml found in your *Frontier_Developments\\Products\\FORC-FDEV-D-1003* folder has VerboseLogging=1 set for the Network section similar to the following:\r\n```\r\n\t<Network\r\n\t  Port=\"0\"\r\n      upnpenabled=\"1\"\r\n\t  LogFile=\"netLog\"\r\n\t  DatestampLog=\"1\"\r\n\t  VerboseLogging=\"1\"\r\n\t  >\r\n\r\n\t</Network>\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrent Features\r\n----------------\r\n* Auto imports [systems.json](https://github.com/SteveHodge/ed-systems/blob/master/systems.json) from https://github.com/SteveHodge/ed-systems/ on initial startup\r\n* Nearly instantaneous *(though currently non optimal)* route planning\r\n* Topmost and Transparency support to display over the game\r\n* Highlights the next system in the route when you enter a new system\r\n* Copies the next system to the clipboard\r\n* Speaks a warning when you enter a system that's not in the system data.  Add it to [EDStarCoordinator](http://edstarcoordinator.com/) and future versions will import it.\r\n\r\nFuture plans\r\n------------\r\nThe current [list of enhancements](https://github.com/hastarin/HAST.Elite.Dangerous.DataAssistant/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement) is a long one.\r\n\r\nIf you do choose to try the app, please feel free to [log any issues](https://github.com/hastarin/HAST.Elite.Dangerous.DataAssistant/issues) you encounter.  If you're lucky I might fix them eventually.\r\n\r\nFor anyone needing it, there is code in there to read data from [EDDN](https://github.com/jamesremuscat/EDDN/wiki) but it's not currently in use.\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n-----\r\nOther open source [Elite Dangerous](https://www.elitedangerous.com/) related projects.\r\n\r\n* [Elite Copilot](https://www.facebook.com/EliteCopilot) ([Github](https://github.com/w0nk0/Elite-Copilot)) - Python based route planner with voice guidance\r\n* [Regulated Noise](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=86908) ([Github](https://github.com/stringandstickytape/RegulatedNoise)) - C# based OCR scanner and trade tool with [EDDN](https://github.com/jamesremuscat/EDDN/wiki) support\r\n* [Quazil's Astro Analytics](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/showthread.php?t=89963) ([Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/Quazil/astroanalytics/)) - C# based trade tool with [EDDN](https://github.com/jamesremuscat/EDDN/wiki) support\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense/Disclaimer\r\n----------\r\n\r\nï»¿The MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2015 Jon Benson\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
